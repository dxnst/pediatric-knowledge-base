# Asthma: Phenotypes
Recognizable clusters of demographic, clinical and/or pathophysiological
characteristics are often called **asthma phenotypes**.

## Allergic asthma
This is the most easily recognized asthma phenotype, which often commences in
childhood and is associated with a past and/or family history of **allergic**
disease such as eczema, allergic rhinitis, or food or drug allergy. Examination
of the induced sputum of these patients before treatment often reveals
**eosinophilic** airway inflammation. Allergic asthma usually responds well to
ICS treatment.

## Non-allergic asthma
Some patients have asthma that is not associated with allergy. The cellular
profile of the sputum of these patients may be **neutrophilic, eosinophilic or
contain only a few inflammatory cells (paucigranulocytic)**. Patients with
non-allergic asthma often experience a lesser short-term response to ICS.

## Cough variant asthma and cough predominant asthma
In some children and adults, **cough may be the only symptom of asthma**, and
evidence of airflow limitation may be absent except during bronchial provocation
testing. Some patients later develop wheezing and bronchodilator responsiveness.
ICS-containing treatment is effective.

## Adult-onset (late-onset) asthma
Some adults, particularly **women**, present with asthma for the first time in
adulthood. Adult-onset asthma tends to be **non-allergic**, and often requires
higher doses of ICS or is relatively **refractory to corticosteroid** treatment.
Occupational asthma should be **ruled out** in patients presenting with
adult-onset asthma.

## Asthma with persistent airflow limitation
Some patients with longstanding asthma develop airflow limitation that is
persistent or incompletely responsive to treatment.

## Asthma with obesity
Some obese patients with asthma have prominent respiratory symptoms and a
different pattern of airway inflammation, with little eosinophilic inflammation.
